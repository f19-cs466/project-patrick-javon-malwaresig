# Project - MalwareSig
Code Written by Javon Kitson :octocat: & Patrick Sacchet :man:

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate current capabilities of antivirus programs, implementing their means of generic malware signature identification. This will be done via the YARA module, using self defined rule files that will determine whether or not a file is malicious. In accomplishing a simple program that can use these rule files in a multitude of ways we hope to educate on one simple way antivirus programs work to continuously scan and keep the security of our own computers safe.  

## How to run
make malwaresig\n
./malwaresig

## File Structure
X

## How it works
### Scanning Functionality:
The scanning is split into two main pieces:
  1. Before scanning, the program sets up a "test" environment by creating sub directories of the current and placing "malicious" files in them
  2. The program will scan through each directory, using the files defined, to "identify" malicious files and remove them

### Overall Functionality:
1. Program prints logo and waits for user input (and validates it)
2. If the input is 0:
  \t- Exit the program  
3. If the input is 1:
  \t- Go through rule defined files, print out each one
4. If the input is 2:
  \t- Create sub directories
  \t- Add files to each sub directory
  \t- "Scan" the sub directories, identifying "malicious" files
  \t- Remove said malicious files
