# Project - MalwareSig
Code Written by Javon Kitson :octocat: & Patrick Sacchet :man:

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate current capabilities of antivirus programs, implementing their means of generic malware signature identification. This will be done via the YARA module, using self defined rule files that will determine whether or not a file is malicious. In accomplishing a simple program that can use these rule files in a multitude of ways we hope to educate on one simple way antivirus programs work to continuously scan and keep the security of our own computers safe.  

## How to run
  ```
  python3 MalwareSig.py
  ```

## How to Install
The porgram doesn't work unless YARA is installed
```
pip3 install yara-python
```

if running in the linux lab then install with:
```
pip3 install yara-python --user
```

## File Structure
X

## How it works
### Scanning Functionality:
The scanning is split into two main pieces:
  1. X
  2. X
### Usability and User interactions
*    Default output is to scan malware_files
* If the input is ```-h```:
  * The program prints a list of possible command line args
* If the input is ```-r```:
  * Pass rule files (requires malicious file(s) passed in addition)
* If the input is ```-m```:
  * Malicious file(s) to be scanned (requires rule files passed in addition)


## Tools used
YARA, Python, & Dr. Olsen's ultimate wisdom and guidance
